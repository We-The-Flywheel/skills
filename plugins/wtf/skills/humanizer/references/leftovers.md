# Leftovers from the chat and the draft (group E, patterns 28-31)

Full guidance and examples, moved verbatim from SKILL.md.

Remove these outright. Nothing here needs rewriting.

### 28. Chatbot residue and sycophancy

**Watch for:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, Great question!, You're absolutely right, That's an excellent point, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** A chatbot's greeting, praise, offer, or closing remains in text that should stand on its own. It is the most certain tell in this list and the easiest to miss when it wraps real content. Remove the wrapper and keep the content.

**Before:**
> Great question! Here is an overview of the French Revolution. It began in 1789 when a financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when a financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

### 29. Knowledge-limit disclaimers and filled-in guesses

**Watch for:** as of [date], up to my last training update, while specific details are limited, based on available information, not publicly available, not widely documented or disclosed, in the provided or available sources, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, likely [grew up, studied, began], it is believed that

**Problem:** The text mentions where the model's knowledge ends, or admits it found no source and then fills the gap with a plausible guess. State what the source does not show, or remove the sentence. **Never present a guess as a fact.**

**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company's founding date is not documented in the available sources. (Or cut the sentence.)

**Before (guess):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.

**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)

### 30. A heading repeated in the first sentence

**Problem:** A heading is followed by a one-line paragraph that restates it before the real content begins. Remove the repeated sentence.

**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

### 31. Writing about the previous version

**Problem:** Documentation and comments describe what the text replaced instead of the current behavior. Mention the previous version only in change logs, release notes, migration guides, and other documents about change.

**Before:**
> This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items, which caused O(n²) performance.

**After:**
> This function uses a hash map for O(1) lookups, avoiding the O(n²) cost of naive iteration.
